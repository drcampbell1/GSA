##### Ross Campbell, Ph.D. #####

This repository contains files for my paper presented at the 46th Conference of the German Studies Association in Houston, Texas on the 15-18 September, 2022. My paper examines the connections between trust and compliance with Covid-19 compliance measures. It extends research which I've published about political support and trust in the Federal Republic of Germany and you can find more about this in my [book](https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9783030037918). You are welcome to download the files, but the article is under review and I would appreciate it if you would not cite or circulate it until further notice.
