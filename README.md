This repository contains files for my paper presented at the 46th Conference of the German Studies Association in Houston, Texas. My paper examines the connections between trust and compliance with Covid-19 compliance measures. It extends research which I've published about political support and trust in the Federal Republic of Germany and you can find more about this in my [book](https://www.palgrave.com/gb/book/9783030037918).
